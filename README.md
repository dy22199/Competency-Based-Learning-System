## Core Components

### 1. Database Schema (`database_schema.sql`)

**Purpose**: Defines the complete database structure and relationships for the competency tracking system.

**Tables Created**:

#### Competency Table
- **Purpose**: Defines learning domains and competencies
- **Key Fields**: 
  - `CompetencyCode` (C1, C2, C3, C4) - Unique competency identifier
  - `CompetencyName` - Human-readable competency name
  - `DomainCode` & `DomainName` - Sub-domain classification
- **Sample Competencies**:
  - C1: Language Comprehension (Reading pace, Vocabulary, Grammar)
  - C2: Math Fact Fluency (Representation, Strategy, Accuracy, Efficiency)
  - C3: Conceptual Understanding (Speed-Distance-Time, Geometry, Measurement)
  - C4: Problem Solving & Reasoning (Understanding, Strategy, Logic, Creativity)

#### Skill Table
- **Purpose**: Defines progressive skill stages within each competency
- **Key Fields**:
  - `Stage` (S1-S7) - Progressive skill levels
  - `StartMMR` & `EndMMR` - Mastery Measurement Range scores
  - `ShortDescription` & `Description` - Skill definitions
- **MMR System**: 0-7000 scale measuring skill mastery level

#### Questions Table
- **Purpose**: Stores assessment questions and answers
- **Key Fields**:
  - `QuestionType` - MCQ, Integer, etc.
  - `QuestionDescription` - The question text
  - `Options` - Multiple choice options (if applicable)
  - `QuestionsAnswer` - Correct answer
  - `QuestionHint` - Help text for students

#### QuestionSkill Table
- **Purpose**: Links questions to specific skills (many-to-many relationship)
- **Structure**: Junction table connecting Questions and Skills

#### User Table
- **Purpose**: Stores user/student information
- **Key Fields**: `UserName` - Student identifier

#### UserQuestions Table
- **Purpose**: Tracks all user question attempts and results
- **Key Fields**:
  - `UserAnswer` - Student's response
  - `IsCorrect` - Boolean correctness indicator
  - `AttemptTime` - Timestamp of attempt
- **Features**: Indexed for performance, maintains attempt history

#### UserSkill Table
- **Purpose**: Tracks user's current skill ranking in each competency
- **Key Fields**:
  - `SkillRank` - Current MMR score for the competency
- **Structure**: Composite primary key (UserId, CompetencyId)

### 2. Database Manager (`database_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Python class providing high-level interface for all database operations.

**Key Features**:

#### Connection Management
- Automatic connection handling
- Row factory for dictionary-style access
- Proper connection cleanup

#### CRUD Operations
- **Competency Management**: Add, retrieve competencies by code
- **Skill Management**: Get skills by competency, MMR range queries
- **Question Management**: Add questions, link to skills, retrieve by type/skill
- **User Management**: Add users, retrieve by ID/name
- **Progress Tracking**: Record attempts, update skill rankings

#### Analytics Methods
- `get_user_progress_summary()` - Overall progress across competencies
- `get_competency_statistics()` - Performance metrics for competencies
- `get_users_by_competency_ranking()` - Leaderboard functionality
- `get_user_correct/incorrect_attempts()` - Performance analysis

#### Demo Functionality
- Comprehensive demonstration of all features
- Sample queries showing system capabilities
- Progress reporting examples

### 3. Database Creation Script (`create_database.py`)

**Purpose**: Automated setup script for creating and populating the database.

**Process**:
1. **Database Creation**: Creates SQLite database file
2. **Table Creation**: Executes all CREATE TABLE statements
3. **Index Creation**: Adds performance indexes
4. **Data Population**: Reads CSV files and inserts sample data
5. **Verification**: Runs sample queries to verify setup

**CSV Integration**:
- Automatically reads from `resources/sample_tables/` directory
- Handles data type conversions (boolean strings to integers)
- Provides detailed logging of insertion process

### 4. Sample Data (`resources/sample_tables/`)

**Purpose**: Pre-loaded educational content for testing and demonstration.

**Content Includes**:
- **17 Competencies** across 4 main domains
- **82 Skills** with progressive stages (S1-S7)
- **Sample Questions** with multiple choice and integer answer types
- **User Data** with example student profiles
- **Attempt History** showing realistic usage patterns
- **Skill Rankings** demonstrating progress tracking
